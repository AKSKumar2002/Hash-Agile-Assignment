Hash Agile Assignment Tasks :)

I have successfully completed my assignment tasks from **Hash Agile Technologies**, conducted online. This repository contains the solutions and programs I developed during the assignment, showcasing my skills in working with technologies like **Apache Solr** and **Python** for data indexing, querying, and manipulation. 

In addition to the main tasks, I have included a program to **find the second-largest element in an array of integers** without using sorting algorithms or built-in array functions. This demonstrates my ability to implement logical problem-solving techniques and work with core programming concepts.

Iâ€™m sharing these files with the GitHub community to provide insights and foster collaboration. Feel free to explore, learn, and enhance the solutions provided!
